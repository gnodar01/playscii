This repo is a fork intended for my own personal use, and is not kept up-to-date with the [official project](https://heptapod.host/jp-lebreton/playscii/) from JP LeBrenton.

The primary purpose of this fork is to use [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) for dependency management.

To launch, install `pixi`, and run `pixi run playscii`

## NFTs

As Playscii's sole author, I have multiple objections to the creation and selling of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) art and do not approve of said use. Legally I cannot stop you but I offer absolutely no support to such users, and I am not interested in engaging with them on this subject. See [this section](http://vectorpoem.com/playscii/#nft) of the project's web page for more information on this.

## Roadmap

For possible future features see Playscii's Trello:

on there especially valuable, feel free to vote or comment!
